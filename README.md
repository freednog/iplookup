# iplookup
This is a python script to take all the IPs in a csv file and run nslookup on them to find the fully qualified domain. It's very simple.

## potential uses
Some web applications log IP addresses along with user activity. And sometimes you need to learn more about the location of these IP addresses. If you have a list of IPs, you can use this script to, say, locate all the residential cable ISP users.
